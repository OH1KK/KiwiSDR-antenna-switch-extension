You need:
- Nano V3.0 CH340G/FT232 ATmega328P MINI USB 5V 16M Micro-controller Board Arduino
- ENC28J60 Ethernet Shield For Arduino Nano V3.0 RJ45 Webserver Module CF

And you have to build your antenna switch hardware too.

Arduino code is available in arduino-nano-netshield subdirectory here or at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OH1KK/KiwiSDR-antenna-switch-extension/arduino-nano-enc29J60-netshield/docs/arduino-nano-netshield/ant_switch_arduino_netshield.ino

You need to modify IP address, netmask and gateway of code.

Put ip address you set into file on Kiwi: /etc/default/netshield
If that file doesn't the default ip address used will be 192.168.0.19
