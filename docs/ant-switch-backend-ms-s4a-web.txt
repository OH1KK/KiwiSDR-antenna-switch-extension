Backend to LZ2RR's MS-S4A-WEB antenna switch.

The MS-S4A-WEB controller only allows a single antenna to be selected at a time (i.e. no antenna mixing).

Factory default IP address of MS-S4A-WEB controller is 192.168.1.234

If your controller has another IP, then you have to create the configuration file
/etc/default/ms-s4a-web with the following:

# KiwiSDR ant-switch-backend-ms-s4a-web configuration file
IPADDRESS=192.168.0.101
